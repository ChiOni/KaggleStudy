# 01. Convolutional Neural Networks

#### Edge detection

#### Padding

#### Stride Convolutions

#### Convolutions over volume

- Consider RGB image: 6 x 6 x 3 (3==#channel numbers)
- By 3 x 3 x 3 filter, we can get 4 x 4 x 1 output
- We can use multiple 3 x 3 x 3 filters, then we can get multiple 4 x 4 outputs

#### One Layer of a Convolutional Network

- Element-wise product => ReLu
  - Linear function => Non-Linear function
- Z[1] = W[1]X + b[1]
- A[1] = g(z[1])
- In cnn, W means Convolution operator

Q. If you have 10 filters that are 3 x 3 x 3 in one layer of a NN,

 how many parameters does that layer have?

= (3 x 3 x 3 + 1) * 10 = 280 parameters

- This means we have fixed numbers of parameters, even if input has very big dimension

Summary

1. If layer l is a convolution layer:
   - f[l] = filter size
   - p[l] = padding
   - s[l] = stride
   - Input = n(height)[l-1] x n(width)[l-1] x n(channel)[l-1]
   - Output = n(height)[l] x n(width)[l] x n(channel)[l]
   - n[l] = (n[l-1] + 2p[l] - f[l])/s[l] + 1



#### Simple Convolutional Network Example

- image size: 39 x 39 x 3
  - Nh[0] = Nw[0] = 39, Nc[0] = 3
  - f[1] = 3, s[1] = 1, p[1] = 0, 10 filters
    - Output size: 37 x 37 x 10
  - Nh[1] = Nw[1] = 37, Nc[1] = 10
  - f[2] = 5, s[2] = 2, p[2] = 0, 20 filters
    - Output size: 17 x 17 x 20
  - Nh[2] = Nw[2] = 17, Nc[2] = 20
  - f[3] = 5, s[2] = 2, 40 filters
    - Output size: 7 x 7 x 40 = 1960
  - Flatten out this channels
    - output: 1
  - Logistic regression or soft max function
    - Final output of y(hat)

Types of layer in a convolutional network:

- Convolution
- Pooling
- Fully connected



#### Pooling layer: Max pooling

- Hyper parameter of max pooling
  - filter size & stride size
- When input 4 x 4, filter size =2 , stride = 2
  - output: 2 x 2
- Max of average pooling
- usually pooling don't use padding

# 06. Softmax Regressionp

#### Recognizing cats,dogs, and baby chicks and other

C = #classes, in this problem = 4 (0,1,2,3)

Then this Neural Net has 4 units output layer.

Each output unit mean the probability of each category in condition X

= Softmax layer

= layer L

- Z[L] = W[L]A[L-1] + b[L]

Activation function:  

- exp(Z[L])

Then the output:

- A[L] = exp(Z[L]) / np.sum(exp(Z[L]{i}))



#### Training a softmax classifier
